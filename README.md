#Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project
Adjust the sliders to create the cumulative means for exponential random variables with n = 40. You can adjust the rate and the number of means to be generated in the simulation. Notice that as the number of means increases, the cumulative mean tends towards the theoretical mean. This demonstrates Central Limit Theorem. This application is created using code I created from the Coursera Statistical Inference course project as part of the Data Science specialisation.
For evaluation purposes, please note that there is no requirement to use actual data to prepare the shiny application. This application is created using simple simulations.
